- **Rich terminal output** with colors, tables, and progress indicators
- **Comprehensive error handling** with actionable troubleshooting guidance
- **Runtime validation** using Zod schemas for type safety
- **Modern TypeScript implementation** with strict mode and full test coverage

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @steipete/inngest
```

## Setup

Set your Inngest signing key as an environment variable:

```bash
export INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY="your-signing-key-here"
```

Get your signing key from: https://app.inngest.com/env/production/manage/signing-key

## Usage

### Check Run Status

```bash
# Get status for a specific run
inngest status --run 01HWAVJ8ASQ5C3FXV32JS9DV9Q

# Get status for all runs of an event
inngest status --event 01HWAVEB858VPPX47Z65GR6P6R
```

### List Runs with Filtering

```bash
# List all runs (default limit: 20)
inngest list

# Filter by status
inngest list --status Running
inngest list --status Failed

# Filter by function
inngest list --function "process-payment"

# Combine filters
inngest list --status Running --function "send-email" --limit 50

# Get all results (may take time)
inngest list --all

# Paginate through results
inngest list --cursor "next-page-cursor"
```

### Watch Runs in Real-time

```bash
# Watch a specific run (updates every 5 seconds)
inngest watch --run 01HWAVJ8ASQ5C3FXV32JS9DV9Q

# Watch all runs for an event
inngest watch --event 01HWAVEB858VPPX47Z65GR6P6R

# Custom polling interval (in seconds)
inngest watch --run 01HWAVJ8ASQ5C3FXV32JS9DV9Q --interval 10

# Set timeout (in minutes)
inngest watch --run 01HWAVJ8ASQ5C3FXV32JS9DV9Q --timeout 30
```

### Cancel Runs

```bash
# Cancel a specific run (with confirmation)
inngest cancel --run 01HWAVJ8ASQ5C3FXV32JS9DV9Q

# Cancel without confirmation
inngest cancel --run 01HWAVJ8ASQ5C3FXV32JS9DV9Q --yes

# Bulk cancel by function (requires app-id)
inngest cancel --app-id "my-app" --function "send-email" --yes

# Bulk cancel with time range
inngest cancel --app-id "my-app" --function "process-order" \
  --after "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z" \
  --before "2024-01-02T00:00:00Z" --yes

# Conditional cancellation with CEL expression
inngest cancel --app-id "my-app" --function "notify-user" \
  --if 'event.data.userId == "user_123"' --yes

# Dry run (preview what would be cancelled)
inngest cancel --app-id "my-app" --function "send-email" --dry-run
```

### View Job Details

```bash
# Get detailed job information for a run
inngest jobs 01HWAVJ8ASQ5C3FXV32JS9DV9Q
```

### Check Cancellation Status

```bash
# Check the status of a bulk cancellation
inngest cancellation-status 01HWAVJ8ASQ5C3FXV32JS9DV9Q
```

## Available Statuses

- `Running` - Job is currently executing
- `Completed` - Job finished successfully  
- `Failed` - Job failed with an error
- `Cancelled` - Job was cancelled

## Environment Variables

- `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY` - Your Inngest signing key (required)
- `INNGEST_API_URL` - Custom API URL (optional, defaults to https://api.inngest.com)

## Examples

### Monitor Failed Jobs

```bash
# List all failed runs
inngest list --status Failed

# Watch for new failures in a specific function
inngest watch --event <EVENT_ID> --interval 30
```

### Bulk Cleanup

```bash
# Preview what would be cancelled
inngest cancel --app-id "my-app" --function "cleanup-task" --dry-run

# Cancel all runs for a function from yesterday
inngest cancel --app-id "my-app" --function "cleanup-task" \
  --after "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z" \
  --before "2024-01-02T00:00:00Z" --yes
```

### Debug a Specific Run

```bash
# Get run details
inngest status --run 01HWAVJ8ASQ5C3FXV32JS9DV9Q

# Get step-by-step job execution
inngest jobs 01HWAVJ8ASQ5C3FXV32JS9DV9Q

# Watch it live (if still running)
inngest watch --run 01HWAVJ8ASQ5C3FXV32JS9DV9Q
```

## Testing

The CLI includes comprehensive validation and error handling. You can test the CLI functionality:

```bash
# Run the included test script
node test-cli.js

# Test specific commands
inngest --help
inngest --version
inngest status --run <valid-run-id>
```

### API Testing

When testing with real API endpoints, ensure:

1. **Valid Signing Key**: Your `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY` has appropriate permissions
2. **Correct API Version**: The current implementation uses `/v1/` endpoints
3. **Network Access**: Ensure connectivity to `https://api.inngest.com`

If you encounter 404 errors, the API endpoint structure might be different than expected. Check the latest API documentation for the correct endpoint paths.
